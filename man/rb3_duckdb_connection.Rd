\title{Returns a DuckDB Database Connection for the RB3 Package}
\usage{
rb3_duckdb_connection()
}
\value{
A DuckDB connection object
}
\description{
This function provides a consistent way to connect to the DuckDB database used by the RB3 package.
It returns an existing connection if one is already established and valid, or creates a new
connection if needed.
}
\details{
The function first checks if a valid connection already exists in the package registry.
If not, it establishes a new connection to a DuckDB database located in the configured
database folder and stores this connection in the package registry.
}
\examples{
# Get a connection to the RB3 database
con <- rb3_duckdb_connection()

}
